# INF1344: Post-COVID Attitudes & Behaviours Toward Cybersecurity & Digital Trust
## Project Overview
This project analyzes cybersecurity behavior, incident exposure, and digital trust in Canada after the COVID-19 pandemic using the 2022 Canadian Internet Use Survey (CIUS). We investigate which groups are more likely to experience cyber incidents, how demographics influence protective behaviors, and levels of trust in technologies and organizations. Derived proportion-based scores summarize key behaviors, providing insights to inform policy, education, and digital inclusion efforts.
